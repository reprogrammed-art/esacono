# Esacono documentation
Esacono is a translation of the concept that generated the series Strutturazioni cilindriche virtuali by Giovanni Anceschi (1963 -1966). The concept is described in issue no. 22 of the magazine il verri, but it was never produced due to the limits posed by the technology of the period. It is a cube suspended by one corner which has six motors embedded into each side. The motors drive two rotating rods that draw six truncated cone shapes in space, creating virtual volumes. The speed varies from motor to motor, and as a consequence so does the effect of the six shapes drawn in the air at the sides of the hanging cube.
