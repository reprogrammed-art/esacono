# how to control 6 motors from a web interface

-upload the Arduino Sketch to the Arduino YUN
	you will need: 
		-the Adafruit_MotorShield library

		-the easy mqtt library
		https://github.com/bobbytech/Easy-Arduino-Yun-MQTT-Client

-open the index.html page
-adjust the sliders and everything should work


-when you go somewhere else you need to change the wifisettings

-you can host the page online... ask Giovanni Profeta

-if you want to set a default mode for the motor, 
just add the code in the setup function without changing the rest
